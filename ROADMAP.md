# PDP8-Py Roadmap

I want to create a set of Jupyter notebooks to explain the architecture and functioning of the PDP-8.

Once they are complete I plan to set up an emulator at the *hardware* level, probably using Logisim.

I'm also planning on building a PDP8-S replica using 70HC00 series logic.

I may also build an FPGA implementation.
